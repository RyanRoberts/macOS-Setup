# macOS-Setup

<h1>My macOS setup</h1>

The purpose of this repo is to have a detailed *backup* of all the software and tweaks I use so that if/when I upgrade my mac, i'll know *exactly what to do.*

This is odd, but if you're so inclined feel free to buy me a cup of coffee @ .
If it makes sense, i'll eventually setup a website to properly showcase my setup.
